You are modifying the state of a globally registered colormap. In future versions, you will not be able to modify a registered colormap in-place. To remove this warning, you can make a copy of the colormap first. cmap = copy.copy(mpl.cm.get_cmap("RdYlBu"))

The 'alpha' parameter to Colorbar has no effect because it is overridden by the mappable; it is deprecated since 3.3 and will be removed two minor releases later.

savefig() got unexpected keyword argument "pdd_inches" which is no longer supported as of 3.3 and will become an error two minor releases later
